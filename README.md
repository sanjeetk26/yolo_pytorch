# yolo_pytorch
This is an attempt to implement of YOLO in Pytorch.

This has been done after referring to the original [paper](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwiF54X7purwAhV3wjgGHY_mBR8QFjAAegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Farxiv.org%2Fabs%2F1506.02640&usg=AOvVaw017FtXr2m7HO50_HFP3dAZ) and a few tutorials.

The main aim of this was for self-learning.

Note:The dataset needs to be downloaded separately and linked appropriately.
